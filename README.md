# The-States
A Reactjs app that will allow you to search through all 50 States and see the fun things to do in its most popular city.
Currently not finished adding all states and deploying.

If you'd like to view the app before I deploy it copy the repo and type "npm start" from your terminal while in the "The-States" folder. 
Otherwise, please wait till im able to deploy it for easier viewing or view the screenshot of the app in its current build on my LinkedIn.
